Non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bond, van der Waals interactions, steric clashes can be visualized using a tool called Non-Covalent Interaction Index (NCI) based on the charge density and it's gradient ([:link: 10.1021/ja100936w](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja100936w)).

The reduced density gradient (RDG), which is calculated using the density and its derivative, can be expressed as (for spin degenerate system):

$$
\begin{aligned}
s(\mathbf{r}) &= \frac{|\nabla \rho(\mathbf{r})|}{2 k_F \rho(\mathbf{r})}\\
&=\frac{1}{2\left(3 \pi^2\right)^{1 / 3}} \frac{|\nabla \rho(\mathbf{r})|}{\rho(\mathbf{r})^{4 / 3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

It describes the degree of deviation of the density from the homogeneous electron gas. 

For typical covalent interactions, the RDG are small due to the high concentration of electron denstiy. However, for regions with low density, only when the gradient is also small will the NCI be small. This only happens when there are some degrees of non-covalent interactions (can be attrative or repulsive to the electron). 
Using the electron density and the NCI, one can easily identify regions where non-covalent interaction is taking place.

To calculate the NCI, we first need to calculate the gradient of the charge density. With VASP's `CHGCAR`, we can use the central finite difference to obtain the gradient:

$$
\nabla f(\vec r)=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial a}(\vec r) \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial b}(\vec r) \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial c}(\vec r)
\end{array}\right] \approx \frac{1}{2 h}\left[\begin{array}{c}
[f\left(\vec r+e_a h_a\right)-f\left(\vec r-e_a h_a\right)]/(2h_a) \\
[f\left(\vec r+e_b h_b\right)-f\left(\vec r-e_b h_b\right)]/(2h_b)  \\
[f\left(\vec r+e_c h_c\right)-f\left(\vec r-e_c h_c\right)]/(2h_c)  \\
\end{array}\right],
$$

where $a$, $b$, $c$ indexes the lattice vectors and $h$ is the infinitestimal small values along the lattice vecotrs.

When the lattice vectors are not orthogonal to each other, according to the chain rule of partial derivation we have:

$$
\nabla_c f(\vec r) = g^T \cdot \nabla f(\vec r) 
$$

where $g$ is a 3$\times$3 matrix that transform the Cartesian coordinates to direct coordinates:

$$
(x,y,z) \cdot g = (a,b,c) 
$$


Once we have obtained the gradient of the charge density at each point, we simply take the mod of it and follow Eq. 1 to calculate the RDG. 

Using Water molecules as an example, by plotting the RDG vs $\rho$, we see that for a monomer (single water molecule), there's no low density, low RDG datapoins, meaning that no non-covalent interacitve is found. The same plot for two water molecule shows a strong peak at low density, indicating that there's a strong non-covalent interaction.

By plotting the these low $\rho$, low RDG points in real space, we see that they do exist between one water molecule's H atom and the O atom of the other water molecule.

Now to identify if the the non-covalent interaction is attractive or repulsive to the electrons, one nees to color the surface using the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the denstiy. According to [:link: this post](https://chemtools.org/sci_doc_nci.html), one can color the isosurface of RDG with $\mathrm{sign}(\lambda_2)\rho(\vec r)$ where $\lambda_2$ is the middle eigenvalue of the Hessian at each point that signifies the type of interactions.

With VASP's `CHGCAR`, we can perform similar central finite difference method to obtain the Hessian and then transform it to the Cartesian coordinate.

For water dimer, we see that the RDG has a large negative contribution, meaning that hydrogen bond acts as a stablizing agent to the two water molecules.

NOTE: one can color the isosurface using VESTA. See [:link: this post](https://www.c2x.org.uk/visual/VESTA_pot.html)

The code I used to generate this plot can be found: [:file_folder: here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/other/2022-11-28-water_NCI.tar.gz)

To obtain these results:
1. run VASP using the files from `vasp_input.tar.gz`
2. rename the `CHGCAR` file from the single water molecule calculation to `CHGCAR_single` and put it and the `CHGCAR` for water dimer in the same folder.
3. run `compare_RDG.py` and analyze `reduced_density_gradient.png`.
4. run `hessian.py` and plot the color RDG using `hess_color.vasp` and `rdg.vasp`.
