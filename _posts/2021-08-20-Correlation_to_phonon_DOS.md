description: Derivation of how to calculate phonon DOS from autocorrelation functions.
---

The autocorrelation function is a cross-correlation function that tell's the correlation of one signal (function) with a delayed version of it self.

To derive the relation between velocity autocorrelation function and the phonon density of states, let us first start with the Fourier transforming the velocity of an atom $i$, $v_i(t)$.

$$
\mathcal{F}[v_i(t)](\omega) = \int_{\infty}^{\infty}v_i(t)e^{i\omega t} dt
\tag{1}
$$

The power spectrum (which tells us how the energy is distributed over the frequency) of this velocity function is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|v_i(\omega)|^2 &= v^*_i(\omega) v_i(\omega)
&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} v^*_i(t) v_i(t') e^{i\omega(t-t')} dt dt'.
\end{aligned} \tag{2}
$$

Substitute $t-t'$ with $t''$, the power spectrum can be re-written as:

$$
|v_i(\omega)|^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} v^*_i(t''+t') v_i(t') e^{i\omega(t'')} dt'' dt'.
\tag{3}
$$

Before moving on, lets assume that harmonic approximation is valid (so that we have zero-width phonon branches), the atomic displacement with respect to time can be written as:

$$
r_j(t) = \sum_s Q_{s,j} e^{-i\omega_s t},
$$

where $s$ labels the phonon branch and $j$ is a composite index for the vibrations of atom $i$ on three spacial directions.
Q is the amplitude of the vibration (with $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2} m_j}$ absorbed in) and $\omega$ is the frequency of the phonon mode.

With the time-dependent displacement derived, the time-dependent velocity can be expressed as:

$$
v_j(t) = \frac{d}{dt} r_j(t) = \sum_s Q_{s,j} (-i\omega_s) e^{-i\omega_s t}.
\tag{4}
$$

Inserting Eq. 4 to Eq.3, and notice we are now using $j$ instead of $i$ to incorporate three spacial dimensions, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|v_j(\omega)|^2 &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{s,s'} Q^*_{s,j}(i\omega_s)e^{i\omega_s(t''+t')} Q_{s',j} (-i\omega_s') e^{-i\omega_{s'} t'} e^{i\omega t''} dt'' dt'\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{s,s'} Q^*_{s,j}Q_{s',j}(\omega_s \omega_{s'})e^{i(\omega+\omega_s)t''} e^{i(\omega_s - \omega_{s'})t'} dt'' dt'\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{s,s'} Q^*_{s,j}Q_{s',j}(\omega_s \omega_{s'})e^{i(\omega+\omega_s)t''} \delta(\omega_s - \omega_{s'}) dt''\\
&= \sum_s \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |Q_{s,j}|^2 \omega_s^2  e^{i(\omega+\omega_s)t''} dt''\\
\end{aligned}
\tag{5}
$$

noting that, due to [ðŸ”— equipartition theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipartition_theorem), the total energy of an oscillator is $k_BT$ where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is temperature.
Since we can express the total energy as pure kinetic energy at the equilibrium position, we get:

$$
E_{tot} = E_{kin} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = Q^2 \omega^2  = k_BT.
$$

Substituting
$$|Q_{s,j}|^2 \omega_s^2$$
with $k_BT$, Eq. 5 becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|v_j(\omega)|^2 &= k_B T \sum_s \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{i(\omega+\omega_s)t''} dt''\\
&= k_B T \sum_s \delta(\omega+\omega_s).
\end{aligned}
$$

If we add contributions from all atoms (assuming there are $N$ atoms) in all three directions:

$$
\sum_j |v_j(\omega)|^2 = 3N k_B T \sum_s \delta(\omega+\omega_s)
$$

remember that the phonon DOS is expressed as
$$\sum_s \delta(\omega_s-\omega)$$, we can write phonon DOS as:

$$
\rho(-\omega) = \sum_s \delta(\omega_s-\omega) = \frac{1}{3Nk_BT} \sum_j |v_j(-\omega)|^2
$$

by the knowledge of Fourier transform of the time-dependent velocity function in Eq. 3, we get:

$$
\rho(-\omega) = \frac{1}{3Nk_BT}\ \sum_j \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} v^*_j(t''+t') v_j(t') e^{-i\omega(t'')} dt'' dt'
\tag{6}
$$

Finally, the velocity autocorrelation function, which tells us how the velocity is changing over time, can be written as:

$$
C_{v}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \vec v(t'+t)\cdot \vec v(t')dt'
$$

or, in a more compact way:

$$
C_{v}(t) = \braket{\vec v(t'+t)\cdot \vec v(t')}.
\tag{7}
$$

Inserting Eq. 7 into Eq. 6, we get:

$$
\rho(-\omega) = \frac{1}{3Nk_BT}\ \sum_j \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \braket{v_j(t''+t')\cdot v_j(t')} e^{-i\omega(t'')} dt''.
$$

For convenience, we can set $t'=0$ since the starting time of a MD calculation is arbitrary and we can always set $t'$ as the "median" of the time period that we run:

$$
\rho(-\omega) = \frac{1}{3Nk_BT}\ \sum_j \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \braket{v_j(t'')\cdot v_j(0)} e^{-i\omega(t'')} dt''.
\tag{8}
$$

With Eq. 8, noting the decreasing nature of the velocity autocorrelation function so that the integral always converges, we see that if we have the knowledge of the velocity of each atom across a period of time (since we cannot do infinity, a we need to have a cut-off time for the integral), we can calculate the phonon density of states.

For periodic systems, the phonon bandstructure can also be interpreted as phonon DOS at each $k$ point.
To obtain this "spectrum" function. we need to Fourier transform the velocity function with respect to the unit cell vectors.
For example, lets say we have a $\sqrt[3]{N}\times\sqrt[3]{N}\times\sqrt[3]{N}$ supercell (so that we have a total of N unit cells) and have a MD trajectory file calculated using it (so we have the time-evolution of the velocity of each atom):

Here, we label the atoms in each cell with $j$ (again a composite label with three direction added) and the unit cell position is expressed as $\vec R$ so that the velocity of atom $j$ at cell $\vec R$ (in three direction) is:

$$
v_{j}(\vec R, t).
\tag{9}
$$

Fourier transform (discrete) Eq. 9 with respect to $\vec R$, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F}[v_{j}(\vec R, t)](\vec k,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\vec R} v_j(\vec R,t) e^{i\vec k \vec R} = v_{j}(\vec k, t),
\end{aligned}
\tag{10}
$$

where we have $N$ unit cell in the supercell


Using Eq. 10, we can express the phonon DOS at each $\vec k$ point as:

$$
\rho(\vec k, -\omega) = \frac{1}{3Nk_BT}\ \sum_j \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \braket{v_{j}(\vec k, t'')\cdot v_{j}(\vec k, 0)} e^{-i\omega(t'')} dt''.
\tag{11}
$$
