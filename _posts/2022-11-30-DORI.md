The Density Overlap Regions Indicator (DORI) proivdes a moderate compromise to find interactions between strong localization (which is usually visualized using the [Electron Localization Function](../../../2022/01/17/ELF.html)) and week localization (which is usually visualized using the [Non-Covalent Interaction Index](../../../2022/11/28/NCI.html)).

The definition of DORI ([:link: 10.1021/ct500490b](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct500490b)) is:


$$
\theta(\mathbf{r})=\frac{\left(\nabla \mathbf{k}^2(\mathbf{r})\right)^2}{\left(\mathbf{k}^2(\mathbf{r})\right)^3}=\frac{\left(\nabla\left(\frac{\nabla \rho(\mathbf{r})}{\rho(\mathbf{r})}\right)^2\right)^2}{\left(\frac{\nabla \rho(\mathbf{r})}{\rho(\mathbf{r})}\right)^6},
$$

where $\vec k(\vec r)$ is the local momentum vector, defined as:

$$
\vec k (\vec r) = \frac{\nabla \rho(\vec r)}{\rho (\vec r)}.
$$

In covalent bonding regions, the density is characterized by the small density gradients, especially at the bond critial points where $\nabla \rho(\vec r) = 0$. In this case, both the nominator and the denominator of DORI are zero, but since the denominator goes to zero faster (6th power), DORI will go to $+\infty$.

Using VASP's `CHGCAR` file, we can use our previous central finite difference method to calculate gradient of the density. As a result, for Benzene, I got the following DORI plot.

And it looks identical to the result obtained from QE's `pp.x`. Note that these results doesn't look like the ones obtained using all-electron code like ADF (see Fig. 3(a) of [:link: 10.1021/ct500490b](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct500490b)). THis is probably caused by the smooth core wavefunction due to the usage of pseudopotentials.

In the mean time, DORI can also be colorcoded using $\mathrm{sign}(\lambda_2)\rho(\vec r)$ where $\lambda_2$ is the middel eigenvalue of the Hessian of the charge density.

And we can clearly see that in the middle, the intraction is repulsive while at the bonding regions, we have attractive interactions due to covalent bonding.

The code to generate these results can be found: [:file_folder: DORI_NCI.tar.gz]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/other/2022-11-30-DORI_NCI.tar.gz). 

To obtain these results:
1. run VASP using the files from `vasp_input.tar.gz`
2. run `DORI.py` and analyze `ELFCAR_DORI.vasp`.
4. run `hessian.py` and plot the color RDG using `hess_color.vasp` and `ELFCAR_DORI.vasp`.
