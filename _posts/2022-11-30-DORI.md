The Density Overlap Regions Indicator (DORI) proivdes a moderate compromise to find interactions between strong localization (which is usually visualized using the [:link: Electron Localization Function](../../../2022/01/17/ELF.html)) and week localization (which is usually visualized using the [:link: Non-Covalent Interaction Index](../../../2022/11/28/NCI.html)).

To define DORI ([:link: 10.1021/ct500490b](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct500490b)) we first need to define a dimensionless quantity $\theta$:

$$
\theta(\mathbf{r})=\frac{\left[\nabla \mathbf{k}^2(\mathbf{r})\right]^2}{\left[\mathbf{k}^2(\mathbf{r})\right]^3}=\frac{\left \{\nabla\left[\frac{\nabla \rho(\mathbf{r})}{\rho(\mathbf{r})}\right]^2\right \}^2}{\left[\frac{\nabla \rho(\mathbf{r})}{\rho(\mathbf{r})}\right]^6},
$$

where $\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})$ is the local momentum vector, defined as:

$$
\mathbf{k} (\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\nabla \rho(\mathbf{r})}{\rho (\mathbf{r})}.
$$

In covalent bonding regions, the density is characterized by the small density gradients, especially at the bond critial points where $\nabla \rho(\mathbf{r}) = 0$. In this case, both the nominator and the denominator of $\theta$ are zero, but since the denominator goes to zero faster (6th power), $\theta$ will go to $+\infty$.

To tame this divergent behavior, the DORI is defined as:

$$
\mathrm{DORI} = \frac{\theta}{1+\theta},
$$

so that its a scalar field with a value between $0$ and $1$ where $1$ indicates the potential existance of a chemical 'bond' or interactions.

Using VASP's `CHGCAR` file, we can use our previous central finite difference method to calculate gradient of the density. As a result, for Benzene, I got the following DORI plot.

And it looks identical to the result obtained from QE's `pp.x`. Note that these results doesn't look like the ones obtained using all-electron code like ADF (see Fig. 3(a) of [:link: 10.1021/ct500490b](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct500490b)). This is probably caused by the smooth core wavefunction due to the usage of pseudopotentials.

Similar to the [:link: Non-Covalent Interaction Index](../../../2022/11/28/NCI.html), DORI can also be color-coded using $\mathrm{sign}(\lambda_2)\rho(\vec r)$ where $\lambda_2$ is the middel eigenvalue of the Hessian of the charge density. For Benzene:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post_img/2022-11-30-img2.png){:height="30%" width="30%" .center}

We can clearly see that in the middle of the Benzene molecule, there is a high value DORI pocket but the intraction corresponding to that pocket is repulsive, suggesting the existance of steric repulsion at the center of the Benzene molecule, while at the bonding regions, we have attractive interactions due to covalent bonding.

As described at the beginning, DORI can also be used to visualize the weak non-covalent interactions. To demonstrate this, I've put two Benzene molecules together. Their DORI turns out to be:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post_img/2022-11-30-img3.png){:height="30%" width="30%" .center}

This plot is almost identical to Fig. 4(e) in [:link: 10.1021/ct500490b](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct500490b). Apart from the regions near the molecules which are similar to our previous results, between two Benzene molecule, there's another region with weak interactions (indicated by the color green). This should be attributed to the weak van der Waals interactions between Benzene molecules.

The code to generate these results can be found: [:file_folder: DORI.tar.gz]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/other/2022-11-30-DORI.tar.gz). 

To obtain these results:
1. run VASP using the files from `vasp_input.tar.gz`
2. run `DORI.py` and analyze `ELFCAR_DORI.vasp`.
4. run `hessian.py` and plot the color RDG using `hess_color.vasp` and `ELFCAR_DORI.vasp`.
