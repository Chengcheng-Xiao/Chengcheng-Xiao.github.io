I find the method used in [:link: this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201806280)
to be quite interesting.
With a bit of research, I can now understand and reproduce some of their results.

First let's [:link: rememeber](../../../2022/01/17/ELF.html) the exchange density matrix:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho_x(r_1,r_2) &= |\rho(r_1,r_2)|^2  =  |\sum_i \psi_i^*(r_1) \psi_i (r_2) |^2\\
& =  \sum_i \psi_i^* (r_1) \psi_i (r_2) \sum_j \psi_j^*(r_2) \psi_j (r_1)\\
& =  \sum_{ij} \psi_i^* (r_1) \psi_j^*(r_2) \psi_i (r_2) \psi_j(r_1)
\end{aligned}
$$

which is the numerator of the [:link: exchange integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_interaction).
Previously, we have [:link: demonstrated](../../../2022/01/17/ELF.html) that the probability of finding electron $1$ at $r_1$ and electron $2$ at $r_2$ is:

$$
P(r_1,r_2) = \rho(r_1)\rho(r_2) - |\rho(r_1,r_2)|^2 = \rho(r_1)\rho(r_2) - \rho_x(r_1,r_2).
$$

Immediately we know that:

$$
\rho_x(r_1,r_2) = \rho(r_1)\rho(r_2) - P(r_1,r_2) ,
$$

so that if one could obtain $\rho(r_1)\rho(r_2)$ and $P(r_1,r_2)$, $\rho_x(r_1,r_2)$ can be obtained.

<!-- which corresponeds to REF's description above Eq. 4. -->

If we integrate over the entire space for both $r_1$ and $r_2$, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\R^3} \int_{\R^3} \rho_x(r_1, r_2) dr_1 dr_2 &= \int_{\R^3} \int_{\R^3} \sum^{occ}_{ij} \psi_i^* (r_1) \psi_j^*(r_2) \psi_i (r_2) \psi_j(r_1)  dr_1 dr_2 \\
&= \sum^{occ}_{i=1} \sum_{i=j} \int_{\R^3} \psi_i^* (r_1) \psi_j(r_1)  dr_1 \int_{\R^3}  \psi_j^* (r_2) \psi_i(r_2) dr_2 \\
&+ \sum^{occ}_{i=1} \sum_{i \neq j} \int_{\R^3} \psi_i^* (r_1) \psi_j(r_1)  dr_1 \int_{\R^3}  \psi_j^* (r_2) \psi_i(r_2) dr_2 \\
&= \sum^{occ}_{i=1} \sum_{i=j} \int_{\R^3} \psi_i^* (r_1) \psi_j(r_1)  dr_1 \int_{\R^3}  \psi_j^* (r_2) \psi_i(r_2) dr_2 + 0 \\
&= N ,
\end{aligned}
$$

where we've used the fact that $\psi$ is orthonormalized and summing to $occ$ gives back the number of electron $N$.

However, if we break up the integration using the Bader basin (each basin being associated with an atom) of the charge density, we can get two different types of "indcies":

- __Delocalization index__: measures the number of electron pairs that are being shared between quantum atoms $\Omega_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{B}}$.

$$
\delta(\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B})=\int_{\Omega_{\mathrm{A}}} \int_{\Omega_{\mathrm{B}}} \rho_{\mathrm{x}}\left(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2\right) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_1 \mathrm{~d} \mathbf{r}_2
$$

- __Localization index__: measures the electron population of each atom basin  $\Omega_{\mathrm{A}}$.

$$
\lambda(\mathrm{A})=\int_{\Omega_{\mathrm{A}}} \int_{\Omega_{\mathrm{A}}} \rho_{\mathrm{x}}\left(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2\right) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_1 \mathrm{~d} \mathbf{r}_2
$$

and we can write:

$$
\int_{\R^3} \int_{\R^3} \rho_x(r_1, r_2) dr_1 dr_2 = N = \sum_A \lambda(\mathrm{A}) + \sum_A \sum_{B \neq A} \delta(\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B})
$$

and the basin associated charge can be recovered by:

$$
N(\Omega) = \lambda(\mathrm{A}) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{B \neq A} \delta(\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B})
$$

## Examples
[:file_folder: Download examples]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/other/2022-10-18-DI_LI_1.tar.gz).

I've prepared to examples using VASP and vaspwfc to generate DI and LI for diamond and MgO.
Fist, we run DFT code and then do the Bader partition of the unit cell to obtain atomic basins.
After that, we read the DFT wavefunction and calculate the exchange density, and then integrate over the basin.

For Diamond, there are two basin. The calculated LI and DI are:

```
Calculated DI : 0.95314
Calculated LI (basin 1) : 1.04748
Calculated LI (basin 2) : 1.04748
```

For MgO, there are two basin. The calculated LI and DI are:

```
Calculated DI : 0.17690
Calculated LI (basin 1) : 3.63374
Calculated LI (basin 2) : 0.01378
```

These results are comparable with the one obtained from the [:link: critic2 program](https://aoterodelaroza.github.io/critic2/manual/) with quantum espresso, as referenced in [:link: this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00549).

However, I wasn't able to exactly reproduce the results of [:link: this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201806280). 
Might have something to do with the PAW transformation or some discrepancies in the definition of DI and LI, I'll put it aside for now.



<!-- For future reference, I've tried to reproduce the results from Wutig's paper, however there seems to be some strange factor problem... -->

<!-- Note that DI calculated in this code is $\frac{1}{4}$ of the value of $\delta(\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B})$ in [:link: this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201806280) due to the fact that they consider $\delta(\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B})$ to be the sum of all AB pairs (here A-B and B-A, hence a factor of 2) and spin degeneracy (another factor of 2). -->
<!-- And if we were to calculate the $2\delta(\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B})$ (y axis in Fig. 1 of [:link:](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201806280)), we would get $2$ for the y-axis value. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- On the other hand, the associated basin charge (related to the x axis in Fig. 1 of [:link:](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201806280)) is defined as: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- N(\Omega)=L I(\Omega)+\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\Omega^{\prime} \neq \Omega} \delta\left(\Omega^{\prime}, \Omega\right), -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!--  -->
<!-- which in our case would be: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- N(\Omega)= 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!--  -->
<!-- and if consider spin degeneracy, it would be $1$ electron, identical to the atomic charge. -->
<!-- The final calculated x-axis value is the difference of N(\Omega) and atomic charge so for Silicon it would be $0$. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- In conclusion, our calculation would put this system at the upper left corner of the map. -->

<!-- NOTE: I've used pseudo WFC for this example. -->
