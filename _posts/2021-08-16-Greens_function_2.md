Like I have said in [ðŸ”—my post](../15/Greens_function_1) about the classical Green's function:

> Green's function method is a way to decompose a complex inhomogenous source using Dirac delta functions and then combine individually solutions to obtain the true answer.

This time, let's take a look of the quantum version in the first quantization formalism.
<!-- Specifically, the version under second qunatization (or, in Fock space). -->

In its time-dependent form, the Schrodinger's equation reads:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi (\vec r, t) = \hat H \Psi(\vec r, t)
\tag{1},
$$

where the Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$ is $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\vec r, t)$.

Write the Schordinger equation in full:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi (\vec r, t) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\vec r, t)\right] \Psi(\vec r, t)
\tag{2}.
$$

Now, this doesn't look like a linear inhomogeneous equation that we're used to in the classical Green's function formulation. However, we can re-write it to the following form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left[i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} +\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2\right] \Psi (\vec r, t) &= V(\vec r, t) \Psi(\vec r, t)\\
\hat{\mathcal{H}} \Psi (\vec r, t) &= g(\vec r, t).
\end{aligned}
\tag{3}
$$

which now looks much like the linear inhomogeneous equation we are after. With only one exception being that the inhomogeneous source $g(\vec r, t)$ being $\Psi(\vec r, t)$ dependent.
We can solve this, but we need a recursive solution to find $\Psi(\vec r, t)$.

Or, with Greens function, instead, we can solve the following inhomogeneous equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left[i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} +\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2\right] G(\vec r, t;\vec r',t') &= \delta(\vec r -\vec r')\delta(t - t')
\end{aligned}
\tag{4}
$$

The solution can be found by:

$$
\Psi(\vec r,t) = \int G(\vec r, t;\vec r',t') V(\vec r, t)  \Psi(\vec r',t')d^3 r'
\tag{5}
$$

Notice that in Eq. 5, the solution is also present in the integral which suggests we still need a recursive or iterative method to obtain the answer, but it shall be much simpler than the original problem.


Now, let's take a good look at Eq. 5, we see that $G(\vec r, t;\vec r',t')$ links $\Psi (\vec r', t')$ to $\Psi (\vec r, t)$, effectively, _propagate_ the wavefunction from one state to another.

To further clarify this, recall that due to energy conservation, the time evolution of a wavefunction can be described using the so-called "time evolution operator" $U(t,t') = e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}H(t-t')}$.
We can also expand the wavefunction in the position representation as: $\Psi(\vec r, t) = \bra{\vec r}\ket{\Psi(t)}$.
Now, let's re-express the wavefunction at $\vec r$ and $t$ time:

$$
\Psi(\vec r, t) = \bra{\vec r} e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}H(t-t')} \ket{\Psi(t')}
$$

Inserting the closure relation of the position operator $\int \ket{\vec r'}\bra{\vec r'} d^3 r' = \mathcal{1}$:

$$
\Psi(\vec r, t) = \int \bra{\vec r}e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}H(t-t')}\ket{\vec r'} \bra{\vec r'} \Psi(t') d^3 r'.
\tag{6}
$$

Comparing Eq. 6 to Eq. 5, we see that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
G(\vec r, t;\vec r',t') &= \bra{\vec r}e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}H(t-t')}\ket{\vec r'}\\
&= \bra{\vec r}e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}H(t)} \cdot e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}H(t')} \ket{\vec r'}\\
&= \braket{\vec r, t\vert\vec r', t'}.
\end{aligned}
\tag{7}
$$

Basically, we have associated the Green's function to the probability amplitude of preparing the particle in a state $\bra{\vec r', t'}$ and later find that that particle in state $\ket{\vec r, t}$.

To give these "states" (which are actually operators) meaning, we need to insert another unitary matrix using $\sum_n \ket{n}\bra{n} = \mathcal{1}$ where $\ket{n}$ and $\bra{n}$ are eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian.
The Green's function is now:

$$
G(\vec r, t;\vec r',t') = \sum_n \bra{\vec r} e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}H(t-t')} \ket{n}\braket{n\vert\vec r'}
$$

since the Hamiltonian $\hat H$ acts on the eigenvectors and gives us $E_n$, while noting that acting the position operator $\bra{r}$ on the eigenvectors $\ket{n}$ gives us the eigenfunctions $\psi_n(r)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
G(\vec r, t;\vec r',t') &= \sum_n \braket{\vec r \vert n}\braket{n\vert\vec r'} e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}E_n(t-t')}\\
&= \sum_n \psi_n(\vec r) \psi_n(\vec r') e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}E_n(t-t')}. \tag{8}
\end{aligned}
$$

This Greens function satisfies Eq. 4 and can be used to construct our general solution to Eq. 1.
