## Background

The Hubbard model is a revised tihgt-binding model suitted to describe solid-state system with prominent correlation effects (i.e. narrow band transition metal oxides). Traditional tight-bidning model does not consider the overlap between orbitals, they treat electrons as isolated particles. However, in some systems, the overlap between atomic orbitals is large enough so that the Coulomb interaction energy cannot be ignored. To solve this, the Hubbard model adds a on-site repulsion term to represent electron-electron Coulomb repulsion. The Hamiltonian can be written as:

$$\hat{H}=-t\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle,\sigma} \hat{c}_{i,\sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{c}_{i,\sigma} + U \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{n}_{i,\uparrow} \hat{n}_{i,\downarrow} $$

The first term is the traditional transfer integral identical to the tight-binding model, where in the second term, the Hubbard U parameters describe the on-site Coulomb repulstion strength.

The Hubbard U and the so called "DFT+U" method can be used to give a more accurate description to the band gap and even recover the insulation nature of some systems. However, the U parameter are typically chosen arbitrarily or fitted to the experimental result. To obtain this value in a self-consistent fashion, several methods like linear response and Density functioanl pertubation theory (DFPT) have been proposed. Here, I'll only give a technical description to the first one as proposed by Cococcioni[1].

## Calculation procedure

Taking the BCC iron as example, the calculation will be conducted using VASP (v5.4.4) and Quantum-espresso (v6.4.1):

### VASP procedure

The on-site potential shift $$\alpha$$ control is a hidden feature of VASP(v5.4+) and is not documented in the official documentation. The documentations I found online was not very through:
 [Marianetti Group](http://grandcentral.apam.columbia.edu:5555/tutorials/dft_procedures/linear_response_u/index.html)
 [VASP forum](https://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp-forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=16400)

To invoke this hidden feature:

```
LDAU = .TRUE.       # invoke DFT+U procedure
LDAUTYPE = 3        # potential shift mode
LDAUPRINT = 2       # print occupation and potential matrix
LDAUU = 0.0 0.0     # energy shift of spin-up electrons
LDAUJ = 0.0 0.0     # energy shift of spin-down electrons
LDAUL = 2 -1        # which orbital to perform procedure
```


Procedure outline:

1. Make a supercell large enough (Since the effect of onsite potential shift can also affect its neighbouring atoms, under the periodic boundary conditions, we have to make a supercell large enough to eliminate interaction between changed site). Here I made a $$2\times2\times2$$ supercell of BCC iron with 8 iron atoms.
2. We only want to shift the potential on one iron site, the `POTCAR` file should contain the two identical pseudopotential information for iron.
3. At first, we do a __self consistent__ calculation __WITHOUT__ potential shift, and save the charge density in `CHGCAR` file.

```
LCHARG=.TRUE.
LDAU = .TRUE.
LDAUTYPE = 3
LDAUPRINT = 2
LDAUU = 0.0 0.0
LDAUJ = 0.0 0.0
LDAUL = 2 -1
... + other scf tags
```

4. Then, a "bare run" __non-self consistent__ calculation __WITH__ potential shift should be carried out using previous saved `CHGCAR`.

```
ICHARG=11
LDAU = .TRUE.
LDAUTYPE = 3
LDAUPRINT = 2
LDAUU = 0.02 0.0
LDAUJ = 0.02 0.0
LDAUL = 2 -1
... + other scf tags
```

5. Similarly, a "interactive run" __self consistent__ calculation __WITH__ potential shift to calculate the charge change with screening.(Here, I choose to read in the charge density since it can sped up the process.)

```
ICHARG=1
LDAU = .TRUE.
LDAUTYPE = 3
LDAUPRINT = 2
LDAUU = 0.02 0.0
LDAUJ = 0.02 0.0
LDAUL = 2 -1
... + other scf tags
```

6. Repeat step `4-5` with different potential shift (typically, I use `-0.08 to 0.08 eV` as potential shift magnitude)
7. Check projected chrage on atomic site, and plot it against the potential shift magnitude. Linear fitting will give the so-called $$\chi$$ value for "bare run" and "interactive run".

    $$\chi=\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \alpha}$$

    Where $$Q$$ is the projected charge number (here d-orbital), $$\alpha$$ is the potential shift used.

8. Finally, depend on accuracy requirement, either reconstruct the whole response matrix or use only on-site $$\chi$$ to calculate the $$U$$ value.

    $$U=\chi_0^{-1}-\chi^{-1}$$

    where $$\chi_0$$ is the bare run result, and $$\chi$$ is the interactive run result.

Results:

- PBE result:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post_img/2019-07-06-img1.svg)
{: .center}

$$\chi_0=-1.1995$$

$$\chi=-0.1618$$

$$U=3.779 eV$$

- LDA result:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post_img/2019-07-06-img2.svg)
{: .center}

$$\chi_0=-1.237$$

$$\chi=-0.204$$

$$U=4.098 eV$$

We can see this value is significantly higher than the published value.

- PBE with $$3\times3\times3$$ supercell:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post_img/2019-07-06-img3.svg)
{: .center}

$$\chi_0=-1.1113$$

$$\chi=-0.2$$

$$U=4.100 eV$$

The size of supercell does not affects the final result significantly, so a supercell of $$2\times2\times2$$ should be enough for this system.

__Response Matrix generation:__

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post_img/2019-07-06-img4.svg)
{: .center}

There are 4 nearest neighbour (labeled red) and 3 second-near neighbour (white) in the $$2\times2\times2$$ supercell. The diagonal terms are the onsite charge number (blue).

From the response matrix, we can see that the symmetry is broken a little especially for atom 8 and atom 7.


### QE procedure
Similar procedure can also be performed by quantum espresso. To enable this feature, following tags are needed:

```
lda_plus_U=.true.
Hubbard_U(1)=1D-40,Hubbard_alpha(1)=-0.05
```
The output of this method contains 3 blocks of projected charge information.

1. initial charge (zero potential shift)
2. Bare response
3. SCF (interactive) response.

So one only need to do one calculation to extract all projected charge number needed for the calculation.

In addition, QE also allows to shift potential $$\alpha$$ with U applied. Simply apply:

```
lda_plus_U=.true.
Hubbard_U(1)="Your U parameter",Hubbard_alpha(1)=-0.05
```

Results:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post_img/2019-07-06-img5.svg)
{: .center}

Final result using only onsite response:

$$U=3.29 eV$$

Final result using full matrix:

$$U=2.94 eV$$
