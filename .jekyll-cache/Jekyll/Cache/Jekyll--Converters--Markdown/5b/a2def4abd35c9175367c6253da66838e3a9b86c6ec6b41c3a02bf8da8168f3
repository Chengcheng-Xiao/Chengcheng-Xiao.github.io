I"<p>This blog will be dedicated to record issues I faced when doing computational work on materials simulations. Especially on how does it happened and how to solve it.</p>

<p>Most of the posts will be related to the technical difficulties and/or tutorials to produce certain type of calculations that I deem interesting or worth writing down for future references.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I cannot compute, I do not understand.  <br /> What I computed and forgotten, I have to do it again.</p>
